  <!-- Note that our use of "jquery.js" has been removed and replaced with the use of
       two different React JS files. The first is core React code containing tools for
       creating components while the second is React code for interacting with the
       browser DOM model.
        
       Note the names of these JS files. These are tailored for development. When you're
       ready to deploy, you would need to remove these and replace them with minified
       production files. Not a big deal but an extra step that falls on your shoulders
       as an app developer. -->
