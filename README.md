# React Samples

These samples pickup where the NodeJS samples left off. While the NodeJS samples focused mainly on writing server code using JavaScript in the Node environment, these samples focus on the client side using React to write front end code in and environment where the back end uses Node and Express.

## Getting Started

If your starting these samples, you should have already gone through the NodeJS samples and should already have Node installed on your system. If you don't, point your browser to http://www.nodejs.org, download the latest stable version, and then install.

From there, please review the README.txt file in the top level folder and then start going through the numbered samples. Each sample contains a README.txt file describing what the sample does and the files that were added/changed from the previous sample. That will help you skip right to the good stuff. The details are heavily commented in the code.

## Prerequisites

These samples assume some knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and writing server code in JavaScript using Node and Express. It's best of you've gone through the NodeJS samples and are familiar with them.

## Lastly

I started this for my own benefit and don't claim to be an expert. Plus it appears that this is an area under constant growth and change and things can become outdated fast. If you have any suggestions for improvement or find any errors, don't hesitate to let me know.
